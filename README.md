# Rias - Discord Bot
### A cute Discord bot that you will enjoy using

Discord library: [DSharpPlus](https://github.com/DSharpPlus/DSharpPlus) (A C# library for making bots using the Discord API)\
Commands library: [Qmmands](https://github.com/Quahu/Qmmands) (An asynchronous .NET Core 2.1-3.0 command framework)

Discord: https://rias.gg/discord (Koneko#0001)\
Website: https://rias.gg/

### Self hosting
Please don't! The bot is open-source just for visualization and possible help via issues or PRs.\
If you take and run the bot then you will have half of the features because some things are coupled together, like the weeb.sh API (private). The bot also communicates with the website for the Patreon and votes features.\
You can, however, take and run the bot if you want to test something or implement something but I don't recommend using it for self-hosting.

If you want to run this bot on your machine you will need the followings:
* .NET 5
* PostgreSQL 12
* Redis
* Also you have to setup the configuration file
